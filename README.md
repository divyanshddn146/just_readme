## 🎯 What is DungeonScribe?

DungeonScribe is your ultimate D&D companion that **listens to your game, remembers everything, and organizes it automatically**. No more scrambling to take notes while you're trying to roleplay, you just have to focus on the story, and let DungeonScribe handle all the complex details.

### The Problem We Solve

**As a Dungeon Master, you're juggling:**
- 📝 Taking notes while describing scenes
- 🧙 Tracking multiple characters and inventories
- 📖 Remembering what happened in the last session
- 🎲 Managing quests, NPCs, and plot threads
- ⏰ Keeping the game flowing smoothly

**DungeonScribe handles all of this automatically** so you can focus on what matters and that is telling amazing stories.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎤 **Live Transcription** — Never Miss a Moment

Just **speak naturally** during your game. DungeonScribe:
- Records everything said at the table
- Converts speech to text in real-time using AI (Whisper)
- Creates a searchable archive of your entire campaign
- Remove mundane chats to keep conversations private.

**Example:**
> 🎙️ *"Alex casts Fireball at the orc horde, dealing 48 damage!"*
> 
> 📝 DungeonScribe automatically:
> - Records the action in Alex's character history
> - Tracks that a Fireball was cast
> - Logs the combat outcome
> - Timestamps the event

### 📦 **Inventory System** — Track Every Item

Never lose track of loot again:

- 🗡️ **Item Database**: Every weapon, potion, and magical artifact

## 🎮 Real-World Example

**Session Scenario:**

> **DM**: *"You enter the ancient tomb. Roll for initiative!"*
> 
> **Player 1**: *"Gandalf casts Light on his staff and moves forward cautiously."*
> 
> **Player 2**: *"Legolas readies his bow and keeps watch at the entrance."*

> **DM**: *"You see three skeleton warriors rise from the sarcophagi!"*

**What DungeonScribe Does Automatically:**

✅ **Transcript Recorded:**
```
[14:23:10] DM: You enter the ancient tomb. Roll for initiative!
[14:23:25] Gandalf casts Light on his staff...
[14:23:40] Legolas readies his bow...
[14:23:55] DM: You see three skeleton warriors...
```

✅ **World State UpdateEvents Detected:**
- 📍 Location → Ancient Tomb (new)   
- ⚔️ Combat → Started with skeleton warriors

✅ **Character Stats Updated:**
- Gandalf: Spell slot used (Level 0 cantrip)
- Legolas: Position noted (entrance guard)

✅ **Quest Log:**

---

## 🚦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to install and run DungeonScribe on your computer.

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

**1. Clone or download the DungeonScribe repository:**

```bash
# If using Git
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DungeonScribe.git
cd DungeonScribe

# Or download and extract the ZIP file, then navigate to the folder
```

**2. Navigate to the backend directory:**

```bash
cd DungeonScribe_Integrated_v3
```

**3. Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt:**

```bash
# Install all required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- FastAPI (web framework)
- Uvicorn (web server)
- Faster-Whisper (speech recognition)
- WebRTC VAD (voice activity detection)
- Pydantic (data validation)
- And other necessary libraries

**Troubleshooting:**
- If `pip` doesn't work, try `pip3` or `python -m pip`
- On Linux/Mac, you may need `sudo` for system-wide installation
- Consider using a virtual environment for isolation

---

### Step 2: Install Ollama and Gemma 3:12B Model

Ollama is the AI engine that powers intelligent event detection and summarization.

**1. Install Ollama:**

**For Windows:**
```bash
# Download installer from https://ollama.ai
# Run the .exe installer
# Follow the installation wizard
```

**For Mac:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install ollama

# Or download from https://ollama.ai
```

**For Linux:**
```bash
# Using the official install script
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

**2. Start Ollama service:**

```bash
ollama serve
```

Leave this terminal window open — Ollama needs to be running in the background.

**3. Pull the Gemma 3:12B model:**

Open a **new terminal window** and run:

```bash
ollama pull gemma3:12b
```

This will download the Gemma 3 model (approximately 7-8 GB). The download may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

**4. Verify the installation:**

```bash
# List installed models
ollama list

# You should see gemma3:12b in the list
```

**Note:** If you want to use a smaller model for faster performance on limited hardware:
```bash
# Alternative: smaller model (faster, less accurate)
ollama pull gemma3:3b
```

---

### Step 3: Install Stable Diffusion (Optional)

Stable Diffusion enables AI-powered artwork generation for your campaigns.

**Option A: AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI (Recommended for most users)**

**1. Install Git (if not already installed):**

**Windows:**
```bash
# Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
```

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install git
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install git  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

**2. Clone the Stable Diffusion Web UI repository:**

```bash
# Navigate to where you want to install it
cd ~  # or any directory you prefer

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui
```

**3. Run the installation script:**

**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click webui-user.bat
# Or run in Command Prompt:
webui-user.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x webui.sh

# Run the installer
./webui.sh
```

The first run will:
- Download dependencies
- Download the default Stable Diffusion model (4-7 GB)
- Set up the web interface

This may take 10-30 minutes depending on your internet speed.

**4. Start Stable Diffusion with API enabled:**

**Windows:**
Edit `webui-user.bat` and add:
```batch
set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--api
```

Then run:
```bash
webui-user.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
./webui.sh --api
```

**5. Verify Stable Diffusion is running:**

Open your browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

You should see the Stable Diffusion interface.

---

**Option B: Alternative Stable Diffusion Methods**

If AUTOMATIC1111 doesn't work for you, try:

**ComfyUI** (More efficient, steeper learning curve):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --listen 127.0.0.1 --port 7860
```

**InvokeAI** (User-friendly, good for beginners):
```bash
pip install invokeai
invokeai-configure  # Follow the prompts
invokeai --web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7860
```

---

### Step 4: Launch DungeonScribe

**1. Start all services in separate terminal windows:**

**Terminal 1: Start Ollama**
```bash
ollama serve
```

**Terminal 2: Start Stable Diffusion (Optional)**
```bash
cd ~/stable-diffusion-webui  # or wherever you installed it
./webui.sh --api              # Mac/Linux
# Or webui-user.bat            # Windows
```

**Terminal 3: Start DungeonScribe**
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

**2. Wait for the startup messages:**

You should see:
```
✅ Database tables initialized

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate

# Restart Ollama
# Close existing ollama serve
ollama serve
```

**Whisper transcription not working:**
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Verify audio input device in system settings
- Try a smaller model: `WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=tiny.en`
- Check Python dependencies are installed

**Stable Diffusion not generating images:**
- Verify SD WebUI is running on port 7860
- Check that `--api` flag is enabled
- Try accessing http://127.0.0.1:7860 directly
- Restart SD WebUI with API enabled

**Database errors:**
- Delete `dungeon_sessions.db` to reset
- Check file permissions in backend directory
- Ensure SQLite is installed (comes with Python)

**High CPU/Memory usage:**
```bash
# Use smaller models
export WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=tiny.en
export OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma3:3b

# Limit workers
export WHISPER_NUM_WORKERS=1
```
